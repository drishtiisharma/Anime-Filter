## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the app by modifying `src/App.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## How to Use

1. **Upload your anime list**: Click "Choose File" or drag and drop your file
2. **Supported formats**: TXT, HTML, or XML files
3. **Automatic filtering**: The app will remove duplicates, movies, OVAs, and specials
4. **Copy your results**: Use the "Copy to Clipboard" button to save your cleaned list

## How It Works

The app uses a smart filtering algorithm that:
- Removes duplicate entries
- Excludes movies, OVAs, specials, recaps, and ONAs
- Keeps only unique series titles
- Processes everything in your browser (your data never leaves your device)

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy this React app is to use [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

1. Build the production version:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Drag and drop the `build` folder to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)

Your app will be live with a free Netlify subdomain (like `your-app-name.netlify.app`).
